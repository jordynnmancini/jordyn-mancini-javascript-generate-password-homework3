## Objective 

For this assignment, I used the provided starter code to build a random password generator that uses Javascript to render a random password based on criteria selected by the user. 


## The Process 

This password geneartor asks the user to select a password length between 8-128 characters, and asks them to confirm if they want lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and/or symbols. If the user selects a character length outside of the perameters, or if they don't select any character types, an error message will appear. Based on the user's selections, an array of possible character types is created. From that, a for loop is used to build a random assortment of characters up to the password length selected by the user. These characters are then joined into a string and rendered on the screen.
